# Griptape Nodes: Lora Training

## Add your library to your installed Engine! 

If you haven't already installed your Griptape Nodes engine, follow the installation steps [HERE](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes).
After you've completed those and you have your engine up and running: 


1. Copy the path to your `library.json`. Right click on the file, and `Copy Path` (Not `Copy Relative Path`)
